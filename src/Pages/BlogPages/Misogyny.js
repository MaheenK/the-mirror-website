                    I remember walking out the cinema utterly confused after watching the movie Punjab Nahi Jaungi. The ‘feminist’ female protagonist goes back to her husband, the same husband who had slapped her after she caught him with another woman. It failed me when the film went onto become the highest grossing Pakistani movie that year. Cut to a few days ago, the comments under the very recent interview given by Khalil ur Rehman Qamar failed me now.

                    The sheer and blatant misogyny disguised under the one magic phrase, “Mein tau khud aik Feminist hoon,” gave Mr Qamar room to elaborate on his very problematic views regarding women and equality, with little to no hesitation. Mr Qamar very comfortably announced that women can never “receive” the equality they demand because they do not go out and snatch purses, or kidnap and rape men. Decidedly, his idea of equality is completely flawed. Mr Qamar also completely disregarded male rape victims with his statement because it implies that men do not get raped by women. This only reflects his sheer ignorance towards the very sensitive issue that VERY much plagues our society and especially the entertainment industry, which Mr Qamar himself is a part of.

                    Mr Qamar also makes the absurd argument that a man who cheats on his wife feels guilty about it, but a woman cheating on her husband feels no shame. The writer claimed that men do not have the ability to say no, but women do. So, if a man cheats on his wife, it is ultimately the “other” woman’s fault for allowing the man to cheat on his wife by accepting his advances. Ironically, he maintains that men are the superior gender despite their tendency to fall prey to seduction.

                    The bottom line is, our society is flawed. Flawed enough to allow a writer the platform to make films and tv dramas that are misogynist to the core. Flawed enough to allow the writer interviews where he is completely confident in his problematic views. Flawed enough to let the writer inconsequentially get away after voicing a very problematic and very misogynist point of views. </p>
