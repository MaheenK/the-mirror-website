                    Very recently, a quite disturbing incident occurred in Peshawar, where 9 men stripped a woman and paraded her in the area, out of which 8 were captured. But why not the 9th one? How can the mastermind of the case, Sajawal, go free while the underlings are caught?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The 2 policemen were bought into custody over why the 9th culprit of the case wasn't caught. Why not even after being accused at large by the victim he roam free? Ask yourself, what happened here? How could the policemen of this country let a major thing slide? Was it bribe? Was the whole thing let go because of personal relationships? It could be anything.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We live in a society where mothers, sisters, daughters and wives are unsafe. Period. Does a man not respect these relationships? Let alone that, does no one give women their basic human rights? Because even after the decision of the Panchayat, only his CNIC was cut-off and was put in the exit control list. Why wasn't there any greater punishment?

                    <br />
                    The police must deal these cases with sharp strictness and attention. No bias can be tolerated here. No one should let cases like these, and criminals like these, go away freely. Every woman must be respected and be listened to. Even though these cases can't fully heal the wounds that will scar them forever, it is vital to give due punishment to the abuser or else even the thought of him/her roaming freely can disturb them. This is blatant injustice. They are not objects or materials which a person uses as he likes. Women must be given the same protection, security and safety that men get for free, everyday. That protection and respect that is a basic human right! </p>
