            An issue that is deep rooted in the culture of Pakistan is child marriages. This idea has plagued the lives of nearly 21 percent of Pakistanâ€™s female population (recorded). What most parents/guardians who wed off their daughters at tender ages fail to understand are the potential risks and consequences that might rise as a result of this. Examples of such risks include fatality during childbirth and an increased risk of pre-mature births which leads to multiple neurological disorders in children. Furthermore, in simple words, underage girls are simply not mature enough to sustain marriage and parenthood.

             Hence, it is high time we join hands and combat early marriages, to fight for the due rights of women. For it is these girls that are the future of the world; they must not be confined to walls of marriage and norms set by the society. Education, freedom of choice, and career opportunities must not be shut out to our women on grounds of gender. Raise your voice against child marriages.
