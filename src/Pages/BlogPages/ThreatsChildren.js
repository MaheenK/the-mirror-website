                Recently, nothing short of absolute horror struck at LGS 39 Main and 1-A/1 Juniors. A girl with Down syndrome was openly molested by her driver who had taken her tights off. This was seen by parents who caught the heinous abuser red-handed and the girl was taken care of by the schoolâ€™s administration, who are now dealing with the issue.

                Everytime we think it could not get any more worse than this, it does. My heart is crying, knowing we have failed our children once again. How could someone be so heartless to commit such heinous acts towards innocent children? These past two days have been filled with sleepless nights, anger, frustration but most importantly helplessness.

                These incidents are a reflection of what happens in our society on a daily basis. Statistics keep on rising, and we as a nation, do nothing. The only silver lining in these two incidents were that the people who witnessed this, took upon themselves to make sure that the culprits were take care of and so they were. Please, if you happen to witness any such thing happen, to a child or anyone se , please take action. Whatever you do can make a difference in someone's life. Let's take it upon ourselves to never let something like this happen again.
                <br />
                <br />
                Also, I urge all parents and guardians to not leave their children unattended with drivers and maids, since this world is sadly a dark, ugly place, and we must protect them from every eye prying on them.
